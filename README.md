## Files

### index.html, script.js, style.css
These files are modeled after the example roboflow webapp and make up a webapp that allows users to select a model to use and then test an image with that model while adjusting parameters

### Python folder
The files in this folder contain functions that were intended to be used but are not in the current web-app. The functions are described in the project report and are here incase I decide to pick this project back up in the future
